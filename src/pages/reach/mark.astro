			<p>Hello Crux.</p> 
			<p>I am a design leader in software design devoted to helping the clean energy transition. My work in finance building internal software tools for fast growing startups and large corporations is the perfect match for the build out of your diligence and workflow tools. In my career I've built design systems from the ground up, I've owned projects from inception to production, leading research, managing small teams, and designing product. At Morgan Stanley I led the design that resulted in thousands of hours of saved employee effort. I want to do the same for Crux.

			<h2>Good with people</h2>
			<p>Software requires aligning diverse skills and expertise across business, technology, and marketing. A natural collaborator, I work across the organization to integrate these perspectives into a shared product vision. Great software comes from great teams, and my approach builds and amplifies great teams.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card">

			<h2>AI driven</h2>
			<p>In 2022 I began using AI to accelerate the analysis of large environmental datasets. Today, the diversity of AI tools has exploded and I use them in every step of software development. From engineering and design to marketing and operations, I'm now getting more done than ever.</p>

		<div class="card">
			<img src="/media/realresearch.jpg">
			<h2>Real research</h2>
			<p>My background in research informs my design process—from the collection and analysis of complex data to the synthesis and communication of results. This drives a clear, rational understanding of product performance. I quantify how features serve different audiences to help teams focus on weak areas, reinforce strengths, and invest resources efficiently.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card">
			<img src="/media/multisector.jpg">
			<h2>Multi-sector experience</h2>
			<p>My background is broad. I’ve worked from finance to education and from environmental research to human health. This diversity of insight and experience means I have more solutions available and produce more creative works. Through the integration of insights across industries, I deliver more competitive results.</p>
