			<h2>Good with people</h2>
			<p>Software requires aligning diverse skills and expertise across business, technology, and marketing. A natural collaborator, I work across the organization to integrate these perspectives into a shared product vision. Great software comes from great teams, and my approach builds and amplifies great teams.</p>

			<h2>AI driven</h2>
			<p>In 2022 I began using AI to accelerate the analysis of large environmental datasets. Today, the diversity of AI tools has exploded and I use them in every step of software development. From engineering and design to marketing and operations, I'm getting now getting more done than ever.</p>

		<div class="card">
			<img src="/media/realresearch.jpg">
			<h2>Real research</h2>
			<p>My background in research informs my design process—from the collection and analysis of complex data to the synthesis and communication of results. This drives a clear, rational understanding of product performance. I quantify how features serve different audiences to help teams focus on weak areas, reinforce strengths, and invest resources efficiently.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card">
			<img src="/media/multisector.jpg">
			<h2>Multi-sector experience</h2>
			<p>My background is broad. I’ve worked from finance to education and from environmental research to human health. This diversity of insight and experience means I have more solutions available and produce more creative works. Through the integration of insights across industries, I deliver more competitive results.</p>
