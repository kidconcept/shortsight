# Corporate Travel

I designed and supported the development of the travel and booking application for Morgan Stanley, a million dollar project that achieved efficiency improvements of up to ten times for key booking tasks. The designs were tested at a seventy five percent increase in satisfaction among users and new features rolled out during the project were hailed as "time savers" and "incredibly useful for productivity".  By integrating and leveraging existing systems we were able to deliver the core designs three months early on a 12 month cycle. The designs represented a major modernization of one of the firms principle internal applications and were a huge success. As lead designer throughout the research and design of the project I helped the firm save thousands of employee hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars in development.

Morgan Stanley had a legacy travel application that had not had a major redesign for over 15 years. Travel for large corporations can be complex with  polices across many lines of business. This internal complexity was why the system had been so long overdue for a redesign. As the senior designer on the project I led the research, workshops, and design sessions to identify the core opportunities for improvement and implement them.
