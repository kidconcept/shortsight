summary: "Chosen to redesign the entry exhibit for the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History, I remodeled the complex entry glass house, bridge crossing, and small shop space. My work included proposing the general layout, procuring new artifacts, and writing exhibit copy. The centerpiece is a scale model 1000 butterfly visualization depicting the dramatic change in the Monarch butterfly population over time."

# Exhibition Design

I responded to a posting from the **Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History** and was chosen to redesign the entry way exhibit for the museum. I am still thrilled with the work we did together and I look forward to future collaborations for public exhibition. I’ve included here some views of process behind the exhibit. The museum gave me the entry way glass house and second floor bridge crossing, as well as an attached small shop to redesign. I began by **modeling the complex space** and proposed the general layout, **procured new artifacts**, and **wrote much of the copy**. The center piece of the exhibit is a scale model 1000 butterfly visualization of the population change over time.

## Visualizing Loss

While The town of **Pacific Grove is known as Butterfly town**, because once millions of butterflies settled their and in the surrounding south west annually. But over the span of 23 years became thousands. What caused this dramatic crashing? And what was it like during their migrations in the 90s when there were still millions in the region? That scale of loss is what this piece is showing.

## Artifacts

I **procured new historical specimens and scientific artifacts**, worked with existing museum artifacts, designed new graphics, and wrote exhibit copy. A video loop shows intimate footage that expose the butterflies fascinating biology and **maps, graphs, and imagery** allow you to examine the butterfly up close and across the long reach of time. Collectively the all work together to tell the story of the rise and fall of this butterfly in our social conscious.

## Modeling

The entry way space is a two story glass house split by a bridge spanning within it. It’s filled with light and the museum exhibits and gardens split off from it in two levels. It’s a complex, central space so it was helpful to do some rough **scale models in 3d** to help visualize the print and assemblage artifacts and show how they interact with the entry way space. I also put together quick **photo collage sketches** to show designs of signage I was proposing in place at the museum. I emphasized meeting in the entry space to discuss placement of artifacts, signage, and the flow of people through the entry way.
